h1. Rails 3 + Mongoid + Omniauth

This is an example *Rails 3 application* that combines *OmniAuth* with *Mongoid*. It uses the "OmniAuth":https://github.com/intridea/omniauth gem to manage authentication using a service provider such as Twitter or Facebook. MongoDB is used as a datastore with the "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/ gem for quick development without schemas or migrations.
